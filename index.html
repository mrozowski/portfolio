    <p>
        I am a highly motivated and skilled Java developer working professionally since 2021. Throughout my journey
        since high school, I have developed a deep passion for software development, architecture, and problem-solving.
        I like to create efficient, testable, and reliable software that solves real-world problems.
    </p>

    <p>
        Previously I worked in a startup with a very dynamic environment where I had to constantly learn new
        technologies and different approaches to project development. I can learn pretty fast anything that is required
        for the project.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am confident that my technical skills, my passion for problem-solving, and dedication to delivering
        high-quality code, will make me a valuable asset to your team.

            <p>
                I developed an Anti-Money Laundering (AML) platform powered by AI. My main responsibility was developing
                microservices to integrate our platform with clients' systems. I utilized cutting edge technologies to
                build scalable, real-time solutions with high performance. Collaborating with various teams from other
                countries and large international financial institutions improved my experience, communication, and
                teamwork skills.
